                    <p>16. Limitation Of Liability
                        EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS
                        HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT
                        ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND
                        ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS

                        SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME
                        STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                        DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
                    <p>17. Termination
                        We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior
                        notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without
                        limitation, including but not limited to a breach of Terms.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service. All provisions
                        of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
                        without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                        liability.</p>
                    <p>18. Governing Law
                        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Philippines, which
                        governing law applies to agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure
                        to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                        rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                        remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                        agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we
                        might have had between us regarding Service.</p>
                    <p>19. Changes To Service
                        We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide
                        via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all
                        or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may
                        restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered
                        users.</p>
                    <p>20. Amendments To Terms
                        We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your
                        responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
                        Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept
                        and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
                        changes, as they are binding on you. By continuing to access or use our Service after any
                        revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to
                        the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.</p>
                    <p>21. Waiver And Severability
                        No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                        continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                        failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
                        such right or provision. If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
                        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision
                        shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms
                        will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>22. Acknowledgement

                        TERMS OF SERVICE AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.</p>
